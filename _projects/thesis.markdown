In this thesis, we demonstrate the innovative uses of deformable interfaces to help develop
future digital art and design interactions. The great benefits of advancing digital art
can often come at a cost of tactile feeling and physical expression, while traditional methods
celebrate the diverse sets of physical tools and materials. We identified these sets of tools
and materials to inform the development of new art and design interfaces that offer rich
physical mediums for digital artist and designers. In order to bring forth these unique interactions,
we draw on the latest advances in deformable interface technology. Therefore, our
research contributes a set of understandings about how deformable interfaces can be harnessed
for art and design interfaces. We identify and discuss the following contributions:
insights into tangible and digital practices of artists and designers; prototypes to probe the
benefits and possibilities of deformable displays and materials in support of digital-physical
art and design, user-centred evaluations of these prototypes to inform future developments,
and broader insights into the deformable interface research.
Each chapter of this thesis investigates a specific element of art and design, alongside
an aspect of deformable interfaces resulting in a new prototype. We begin the thesis by
studying the use of physical actuation to simulate artist tools in deformable surfaces. In this
chapter, our evaluations highlight the merits of improved user experiences and insights into
eyes-free interactions. We then turn to explore deformable textures. Driven by the tactile
feeling of mixing paints, we present a gel-based interface that is capable of simulating
the feeling of paints on the back of mobile devices. Our evaluations showed how artists
endorsed the interactions and held potential for digital oil painting.
Our final chapter presents research conducted with digital designers. We explore their
colour picking processes and developed a digital version of physical swatches using a modular
screen system. This use of tangible proxies in digital-based processes brought a level
of playfulness and held potential to support collaborative workflows across disciplines. To
conclude, we share how our outcomes from these studies could help shape the broader space
of art and design interactions and deformable interface research. We suggest future work
and directions based on our findings.

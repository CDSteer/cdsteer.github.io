Colour picking is a creative experience that designers approach with care and attention. Digital colour picking consists mostly of
graphical interfaces that reduce the engagement previously achieved in traditional physical methods. We engaged with teams of
practising designers aiming at understanding their workflows and what elements could improve with tangible interfaces. Based on
these discussions we outline the major elements of the designer’s colour picking process: discovery, manipulation and presentation.We
highlight the constraints designers face and outline how tangible devices could enhance their experience. Furthermore, we demonstrate
these elements in DigiSwatch, a prototype interface that allows individuals and groups to discover and manipulate colours on modular
screens using physical interactions. These screens sense adjacent colours enabling dynamic colour discovery and colour contrast
inspection. The designers’ feedback revealed DigiSwatch addresses constraints faced when colour is picked by reducing the number of
external tools needed, as well as provides a fun and engaging experience. Feedback also highlighted its usefulness for collaborative
work with non-designers and team members.

I founded Finative in the [Alacrity Foundation](https://alacrityfoundation.co.uk/)'s 15-month programme. On the program, I gained practical business training, software development skills and world-class mentoring to help found and launch Finative.

Finative helps commercial finance brokers minimise admin and focus on their client's financial needs. I help found and initial and start the company. I took on a Director role that oversaw the intersection of technology and business operations. While part of the team I lead product development, UX design, marketing and general business operations.

Finative was shortlisted for the Welsh Start-up Awards 2020.

While I enjoyed many aspects of starting and running a business, I left Finative in January 2020. I left in order to return to academic to pursue to work on more creative projects and make plans to return to academic research pick up where I finished off my PhD.

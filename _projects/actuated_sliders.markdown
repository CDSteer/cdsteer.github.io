I designed and developed a shape-changing slider prototype where the graspable cursor can change its size depending on its position on a track. The track was made up of two bars on which the cursor could sit and slide from left to right. On one side of the track, I attached a distance sensor. This tracked the position of the cursor in order for it to be communicated to the application in use. This application then maps the position value to generate an output.

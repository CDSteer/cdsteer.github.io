<strong>I work in the field of human-computer interaction and user experience, where I work on novel interaction techniques, tangible interfaces and shape changing technologies.</strong>

My PhD thesis focused on enhancing digital art and design technology with new tangible augmentations such as mobiles that feel like paint or module screens for colour exploration. In pursuit of bringing ideas to life I engaged with people in workshops and interviews for scoping ideas, built prototypes and testing them in user studies. During this time I enhanced my skills in rapid software and hardware (including some chemical) prototyping. I used a wide range of UX research methods, and conducted the necessary data analysis to test research questions and validate ideas. During my PhD I presented academic papers in world-leading conferences, collaborated with BBC R&D, and was a finalist in EPSRC Nation of Pioneers.
